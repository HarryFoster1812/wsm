This was forked from akioweh who i have worked with to produce this so shoutout to him.

A simple webmessaging sit that uses html and css as the front end which allows users to send send and see recived chats

The backend uses a python server running with websockets which processes and relays all of the mesages to the clients which send and recive messages using javascript and websockets

If you are to use this for yourself change the server ipadress in both the python and javascript

The default display name for each user is "Unknown" which can be changed by using the command "cdn <Your name here>"

Other features are going to be implemented such as added encryption using publick key cryptography and also a confirmation message that the diplay name has been changed and also messgaes alerting the user that they have been disconected in certain instances. If you have any other suggestions please let me know and i will see what i can do.
